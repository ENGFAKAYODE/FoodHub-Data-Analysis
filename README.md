# FoodHub-Data-Analysis
A food aggregator company has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants which will help them in enhancing their customer experience. I answered potential questions the Data Science team could have that will help the company to improve the business. I also provided actionable recommendations based on the strategic insights derived from the data.
